# Software / system dependencies (links & install notes)

1) Python (must 3.10)
   - Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Install: choose "Add Python to PATH" on Windows installer.

2) MongoDB Community Server (for storing faces / attendance)
   - Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
   - Quick start (Windows): install MSI, start the MongoDB Windows service or run `mongod`.
   - Set environment variable for the app (PowerShell):
     setx MONGO_URI "mongodb://localhost:27017"
     Restart your terminal/VS Code for the env var to be visible.

3) Visual Studio Build Tools (required to compile dlib on Windows)
   - Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - During install select: "Desktop development with C++" workload.
   - After installation use *x64 Native Tools Command Prompt* (Start menu) or run:
     "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\20xx\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
   - Verify 'cl' is available: run `cl` in the native tools prompt.

4) CMake (required to build dlib)
   - Download: https://cmake.org/download/
   - When installing add CMake to your PATH.
   - Verify: `cmake --version`

5) PortAudio / PyAudio (microphone access)
   - PortAudio: https://portaudio.com/
   - Windows: use prebuilt wheel via pipwin or Gohlke wheels (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
   - Commands: `pip install pipwin` then `pipwin install pyaudio`

6) (Optional recommended) Miniconda / Anaconda (easier approach to get prebuilt dlib)
   - Download Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
   - Example commands:
     conda create -n attend python=3.10 -y
     conda activate attend
     conda install -c conda-forge dlib -y
     pip install face_recognition opencv-contrib-python pymongo webrtcvad

7) Git (for repository management)
   - Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Example: `git clone <repo>` ; `git pull origin main`

8) Notes on Windows pitfalls / tips
   - If `dlib` build fails: ensure CMake and MSVC toolchain are installed and you used the x64 Native Tools command prompt.
   - If `pipwin` fails on Python 3.13, prefer using conda/Miniconda or install matching wheels from Gohlke.
   - If OpenCV LBPH fallback is required, install `opencv-contrib-python` (includes `cv2.face` module).

If you'd like, I can also create a small `setup_instructions.md` with step-by-step screenshots/commands tailored to Windows and include the exact commands your partner should run. Would you like that? (Yes/No)
